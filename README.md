# Multilingual Machine Generated Text Detection

This project aims to detect machine-generated text across multiple languages using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The project includes several Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate different approaches and models for detecting machine-generated text.

The project is accepted at the 2024 WI-IAT IEEE conference. Link to the paper will be provided soon.

## Future Work
A more generalised framework for detecting machine-generated text across multiple languages will be developed. The framework will include a wide range of models and techniques for text detection, including deep learning, machine learning, and hybrid models. The framework will be evaluated on a diverse set of datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness. The library will be made available as an open-source project to the research community.
